># **What words did certain artists enjoyed to use in their songs? What are the differences among selected artists? Why is Rock music so popular?**
><center>By Saier Gong</center>

Have you ever felt like that this is the first you've heard a song but have a sense of familarity and believe that this song is just made for you?
Did you ever fall in love with a song just because of a word or a sentence? 
Listening to the songs, we can know the stories of the artists and sometimes the stories are just ours.

```



## Part 1. A Preliminary Understanding of the Data and Data Cleaning

In this part, we can have a look at the data and decide which parts of the data we are most interested in and will analyze them later.

First of all, when we have the "lyrics" dataset for the first time, we'd like to find out like how many songs this artist have sung and how many songs were in this genre in a certain period and so on.

### Choose the Data We like

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
lyric<-dt_lyrics


#the number of songs in each genre in each year
peak<-lyric %>%
  filter(year>1960) %>%
  filter(genre!='other') %>%
  group_by(genre,year) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup(year) %>%
  arrange(genre,desc(n))

peak

#
#the max number of songs in each genre per year through these years
peak_dot<-peak %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(n=max(n)) %>%
  inner_join(peak)
peak_dot
```

We can see that before 1990, the total number of songs in each genre per year is much smaller expecially compared with the number of songs after 1900, therefore, we only consider **the songs in each genre per year after 1990**.


```{r,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}

#total number of songs per genre per year after 1990 

peak_plot<-ggplot(data=peak %>% filter(year>1990),mapping = aes(x=year,y=n,color=genre))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title='The Number of Songs in Each Genre V.S. Year after 1990',
       x="Year",
       y="Total Number Per Year")+
  geom_point(data=peak_dot,mapping = aes(x=year,y=n),color='black')+
  geom_vline(data=peak_dot,aes(xintercept = year),size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(min(peak$year),max(peak$year),2))+
  theme_light()

peak_plot

```

From the "peak_plot", we can clearly see that :

1. the total number of songs created in each genre reaches the peak after 2006;
2. in year 2006, the number of songs belonging to 8 genres reaches peak amount, respectively;
3. in year 2006-2008, the number of songs in almost each genre is much more greater than in other years;
4. the number of songs in genre Rock is greater than the number in any other genres in nearly each year, especially in year 2006-2008, the number is much more greater.

    
So, we will focus on the data **between 2006 and 2008**.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#in Year 2006-2008-----new_lyric
new_lyric<-lyric %>%
  filter(year>1960) %>%
  filter(genre!='other') %>%
  filter(between(year,2006,2008))

```



## Part 2. Which words would they love to use in period 2006-2008?
Based on the data we choose in Part 1, to answer this question, we need to choose some artists that are most representative of that period (Year 2006-2008).

Therefore, we make a list of the **3 artists** who had the most songs in that period, and find out the frequencies they used the words in the following list in their songs during that period.

**word list{i,love,you,baby,girl,cry,dance}**

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#find out 3 artists who have the most songs in year 2006-2008
song_number_top_3<-new_lyric %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(3)

song_number_top_3

#The 3 artists are dolly-parton, eddy-arnold and barbra-streisand

dolly_parton.lyric<-new_lyric %>%
  filter(artist=='dolly-parton')

eddy_arnold.lyric<-new_lyric %>%
  filter(artist=='eddy-arnold')

barbra_streisand.lyric<-new_lyric %>%
  filter(artist=='barbra-streisand')


#### word list{i,love,you,baby,girl,cry,dance}

word<-c("i","love","you","baby","girl","cry","dance")


#write a function to calculate the frequency of each word by each artist
count_word<-function(df,word){
  sum(map_dbl(df$stemmedwords,function(x) str_detect(x,word)))/length(df$stemmedwords)
}

dolly_freq_word<-tibble(artist="dolly-parton",word=word,freq=map_dbl(word,function(x) count_word(df=dolly_parton.lyric,x)))

eddy_freq_word<-tibble(artist="eddy-arnold",word=word,freq=map_dbl(word,function(x) count_word(df=eddy_arnold.lyric,x)))

barbra_freq_word<-tibble(artist="barbra-streisand",word=word,freq=map_dbl(word,function(x) count_word(df=barbra_streisand.lyric,x)))


word.freq<-rbind(dolly_freq_word,eddy_freq_word,barbra_freq_word)

ggplot(data=word.freq,mapping = aes(x=word,y=freq,color=artist))+
  geom_point(size=5)+
  labs(title = "Word Using Frequency by 3 Artist during 2006-2008",
       xlab="word",ylab="frequency")+
  theme_light()



```

From this plot, we can see that every song they sang had word "i", and they used "love" and "you" more than other words. So, it is interesting to imply that 10 years ago people loved to say "i love you" in their songs just like nowadays.(At least I have heard a lot of songs containg "i love you" no matter what language they are.) 

![](../figs/iloveyou.jpg)


## Part 3. Sentence Analysis of the Top 3 Artists in Period 2006-2008
First, we need to load the dataset to analyze the sentences.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#2006-2008 period sentences 
#the rest genres to be analyzed 1."Hip-Hop"  2. "Pop" 3."Metal" 4. "Rock"  5."Country"   6.  "Jazz"  7."Not Available" 8."Electronic"   
load("../output/top_3.Rdata")
```


Then, let's continue analyzing the top 3 artists discussed before, to analyze the length of sentences in their songs, respectively.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
##the top_3 artist discussed before

top_3$artist=factor(top_3$artist)
top_3$artistOrdered=reorder(top_3$artist, top_3$word.count, 
                                  mean, 
                                  order=T)

par(mar=c(4, 11, 2, 2))
beeswarm(word.count/20~artist, 
         data=top_3,
         horizontal = TRUE, 
         pch=16, col=alpha(brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), 0.6), 
         cex=0.55, cex.axis=0.8, cex.lab=0.8,
         spacing=5/nlevels(top_3$artistOrdered),
         las=2, xlab="Number of words in a sentence.", ylab="",
         main="the Sentence Length in Top 3 Singers in Year 2006-2008")


```

From the plot, we can see that dolly-parton preferred using shorter sentences compared with eddy and barbra. But they three all used shorter sentences more than longer sentences.
Maybe because shorter sentences are easy to remember and can fit the rhythm they are good at perfectly.
What's more, barbra-streisand had more sentences with length less than 5, while the other 2 artists between 5 and 10.



## Part 4. Sentiment Analysis of Genre Rock
I like Rock!

![](../figs/rock.jpg)

And as we have seen before, much more songs belong to **genre Rock** than other genres, therefore, it is a good idea to analyze the data and find out **why many artists love Rock**.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#######################filter genre Rock from original lyric containing all years

rock<-lyric %>%
  filter(genre=='Rock')

#the number od Rock songs in every year
rock.number<-rock %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

ggplot(data=rock.number,mapping = aes(x=year,y=n)) +
  geom_line(size=2)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=2006,color='red',size=2)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=2007,color='green',size=2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970,2016,3))+
  labs(title = 'the Number of Rock Songs in Every Year',
       x='year',
       y='number of rock songs')+
  theme_light()
```
From this plot, we can see that in 2006, there are more rock songs than other years. Then, we want to know which artists contributed most to the huge number of Rock songs compared with other genres.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

rock.number_artist<-rock %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

rock.number_artist

```
We can see that **elton-john** has the most Rock songs, 619, and then it is **bob-dylan**, 563.
So, let's have a look at their **feelings** in their Rock songs.

### First, let's analyze the emontions in **elton-john's songs**.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

rock.elton_john<-rock %>%
  filter(artist=='elton-john')
load(file="../output/rock_elton_john_list.RData") #contains the emotions
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#the emotions plot
emo.means=colMeans(select(rock.elton_john.list, anticipation:sadness))
col.use=c("darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1",
            "red2", "chartreuse3", "blueviolet","dodgerblue3")
barplot(emo.means[order(emo.means)], las=2, col=col.use[order(emo.means)], horiz=T, main="elton-john")

```
From this plot, we can find out that elton-john usually expressed his **fear, anger,joy and sadness** in his Rock songs.

So, we will focus on the four main feelings.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#four feelings
ggplot(data=rock.elton_john.list %>%select(year,fear,anger,joy,sadness) %>%
         pivot_longer(cols = -year,names_to = 'sentiment',values_to = 'value'))+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=year,y=value))+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment)+
  labs(title = "How often he used these feelings every year, respectively?",
       xlab="Year",
       ylab="value")+
  theme_light()


```

From these plots, we can see that in year 1990, he expressed more negative feelings.
Therefore, we will focus on the sentences he sang with **negative feelings in year 1990**.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#negative feelings in year 1990 sentences
df_elton_john_1990=tbl_df(rock.elton_john.list)%>%
  filter(year==1990,word.count<=50) %>%
  select(sentences,fear,anger,sadness) %>%
  filter(fear>0&anger>0&sadness>0)
df_elton_john_1990=as.data.frame(df_elton_john_1990)
(as.character(df_elton_john_1990$sentences))

```
The word he mentioned most times was "Slave".

### Second, let's go on analyzing the emotions of **bob-dylan**, who also made great contributions to Rock songs.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
rock.bob_dylan<-rock %>%
  filter(artist=='bob-dylan')
load("../output/rock_bob_dylan_list.RData") #contains the emotions
```

We will use the same steps as we analyze elton-john above.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
emo.means=colMeans(select(rock.bob_dylan.list, anticipation:sadness))
col.use=c("darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1", "darkgoldenrod1",
            "red2", "chartreuse3", "blueviolet","dodgerblue3")
barplot(emo.means[order(emo.means)], las=2, col=col.use[order(emo.means)], horiz=T, main="bob-dylan")


```

From this plot, we can see that bob usually expressed **anger, anticipation, disgust and fear** in his Rock songs.
So, we will focus on the four main feelings.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}

#four feelings
ggplot(data=rock.bob_dylan.list %>%select(year,anger,anticipation,disgust,fear) %>%
         pivot_longer(cols = -year,names_to = 'sentiment',values_to = 'value'))+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=year,y=value))+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment)+
  labs(title = "How often he used these feelings every year, respectively?",
       xlab="Year",
       ylab="value")+
  theme_light()

```
From these plots, we can see that bob expressed anger and anticipation more in year 2006.
Let's see the sentences about **anger and anticipation, respectively**.


**anger**
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#2006 anger feeling
df_bob_dylan_2006_anger=tbl_df(rock.bob_dylan.list)%>%
  filter(year==2006,word.count<=10) %>%
  select(sentences,anger) %>%
  filter(anger>0)
df_bob_dylan_2006_anger=as.data.frame(df_bob_dylan_2006_anger)
(as.character(df_bob_dylan_2006_anger$sentences))

```

**anticipation**
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#2006 anticipation feeling
df_bob_dylan_2006_anticipation=tbl_df(rock.bob_dylan.list)%>%
  filter(year==2006,word.count<=10) %>%
  select(sentences,anticipation) %>%
  filter(anticipation>0)
df_bob_dylan_2006_anticipation=as.data.frame(df_bob_dylan_2006_anticipation)
(as.character(df_bob_dylan_2006_anticipation$sentences))

```


Also from the above plots, we can see that he expressed **disgust** more in year **1990**.

**disgust**
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
df_bob_dylan_1990_disgust=tbl_df(rock.bob_dylan.list)%>%
  filter(year==1990,word.count<=10) %>%
  select(sentences,disgust) %>%
  filter(disgust>0)
df_bob_dylan_1990_disgust=as.data.frame(df_bob_dylan_1990_disgust)
(as.character(df_bob_dylan_1990_disgust$sentences))

```

## Part 5. Topic Modeling about Rock Songs in Year 2006
**Why we choose the year 2006?**
Because from early dataset, there are far more rock songs in 2006 than in any other years.
We will choose some represents to analyze this topic.


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#2006 has the most rock songs
#choose the person which has more than 400 songs 


rock_2006<-rock %>%
  filter(year==2006) %>%
  inner_join(rock.number_artist %>% filter(n>400))


load("../output/rock_2006_list.RData")#contains emotions
```
### First,let's have a look at its properties of sentences.


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
par(mar=c(4, 11, 2, 2))
sel.comparison=unique(rock_2006.list$artist)
rock_2006_sel=filter(rock_2006.list, artist%in%sel.comparison)
rock_2006_sel$artist=factor(rock_2006_sel$artist)
rock_2006_sel$artistOrdered=reorder(rock_2006_sel$artist, 
                                  rock_2006_sel$word.count, 
                                  mean, 
                                  order=T)
beeswarm(word.count/50~artistOrdered, 
         data=rock_2006_sel,
         horizontal = TRUE, 
         pch=16, col=alpha(brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), 0.6), 
         cex=0.55, cex.axis=0.8, cex.lab=0.8,
         spacing=1.2/nlevels(rock_2006_sel$artistOrdered),
         las=2, xlab="Number of words in a sentence.", ylab="",
         main="rock in 2006")


```
From this plot, we can see that bob-fylan perferred using longer sentences than other artists and eric-clapton had many short sentences.
  
  
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
par(mfrow=c(4,1), mar=c(1,0,2,0), bty="n", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", font.main=1)
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="elton-john")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="bob-dylan")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="elvis-costello")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="david-bowie")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="bruce-springsteen")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="eric-clapton")
f.plotsent.len(In.list=rock_2006.list, InArtist="beach-boys")



```
From these plots, we can see:

1. elton-john had more joy, anger and fear;
2. bob-dylan had more joy or anticipation;
3. elvis-costello had more fear;
4. david-bowie had more disgust;
5. bruce-springsteen had more joy and anger;
6. eric-clapton had more anger and joy;
7. beach-boys had more joy and sadness.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
rock_2006.summary=tbl_df(rock_2006_sel)%>%
  #group_by(paste0(type, File))%>%
  group_by(artist)%>%
  summarise(
    anger=mean(anger),
    anticipation=mean(anticipation),
    disgust=mean(disgust),
    fear=mean(fear),
    joy=mean(joy),
    sadness=mean(sadness),
    surprise=mean(surprise),
    trust=mean(trust)
    #negative=mean(negative),
    #positive=mean(positive)
  )
rock_2006.summary=as.data.frame(rock_2006.summary)
rownames(rock_2006.summary)=as.character((rock_2006.summary[,1]))
km.res=kmeans(rock_2006.summary[,-1], iter.max=200,
              3)
fviz_cluster(km.res, 
             stand=F, repel= TRUE,
             data = rock_2006.summary[,-1], xlab="", xaxt="n",
             show.clust.cent=FALSE)
```
If we want to divide these 7 artist into 3 groups based on their feeling expression, we can have elton-john, david-bowie and beach-boys in green group, bob-dylan and bruch-springsteen in red group, and eric-clapton and elvis-costello in blue group.


After we get familiar with the data, let's start topic modeling.

### Topic modeling

```{r warning=FALSE, r,message=FALSE}

#topic modeling


corpus.list=rock_2006.list[2:(nrow(rock_2006.list)-1), ]
sentence.pre=rock_2006.list$sentences[1:(nrow(rock_2006.list)-2)]
sentence.post=rock_2006.list$sentences[3:(nrow(rock_2006.list)-1)]
corpus.list$snipets=paste(sentence.pre, corpus.list$sentences, sentence.post, sep=" ")
rm.rows=(1:nrow(corpus.list))[corpus.list$sent.id==1]
rm.rows=c(rm.rows, rm.rows-1)
corpus.list=corpus.list[-rm.rows, ]

docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(corpus.list$snipets))

```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
docs <-tm_map(docs,content_transformer(tolower))

docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)

docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)

docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)

docs <- tm_map(docs,stemDocument)
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

## generate document-term matrices
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(docs)
rowTotals <- apply(dtm , 1, sum) 
dtm  <- dtm[rowTotals> 0, ]
corpus.list=corpus.list[rowTotals>0, ]


```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

## run LDA for all rock songs in 2006 and artists who had more than 400 songs in total
burnin <- 4000
iter <- 2000
thin <- 500
seed <-list(2003,5,63,100001,765)
nstart <- 5
best <- TRUE

# number of topics
k <- 10

load("../output/ldaOut.RData")
ldaOut.topics <- as.matrix(topics(ldaOut))

# top 20 terms in each topic
ldaOut.terms <- as.matrix(terms(ldaOut,20))
ldaOut.terms

# probabilities associated with each topic assignment
topicProbabilities <- as.data.frame(ldaOut@gamma)
terms.beta=ldaOut@beta
terms.beta=scale(terms.beta)

  topics.terms=rbind(topics.terms, ldaOut@terms[order(terms.beta[i,], decreasing = TRUE)[1:7]])
}

topics.terms




```

I set the topic numbers to be 10. I manually tag them as "Sing a Song", "Feeling", "Location", "attitude", "Joyful", "Lost&Found", "Love", "Time", "Care", "Hope". Because :

1. Topic 1 contains the key words: "dance","roll"; 
2. Topic 2 contains "yeah","feel"; 
3. Topic 3 contains "town","home";
4. Topic 4 contains "will","right";
5. Topic 5 contains "well","back"; etc.
    

Based on the most popular terms and the most salient terms for each topic, we assign the hashtags to each topic.  
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
topics.hash=c("Sing a Song", "Feeling", "Location", "attitude", "Joyful", "Lost&Found", "Love", "Time", "Care", "Hope")
corpus.list$ldatopic=as.vector(ldaOut.topics)
corpus.list$ldahash=topics.hash[ldaOut.topics]
colnames(topicProbabilities)=topics.hash
corpus.list.df=cbind(corpus.list, topicProbabilities) 


```

We use heatmap to see the weight allocation of topics for each artist:

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}

par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
topic.summary=tbl_df(corpus.list.df)%>%
              select(artist, `Sing a Song`:Hope)%>%
              group_by(artist)%>%
              summarise_each(funs(mean))
topic.summary=as.data.frame(topic.summary)
heatmap.2(as.matrix(topic.summary[,-1]),Rowv = FALSE,
           scale = "column", key=F, 
           col = bluered(100),
           cexRow = 0.9, cexCol = 0.9, margins = c(8, 8),
           trace = "none", density.info = "none")

```
From this plot, we can conclude that:

1. beach-boys expressed more Feeling and Hope topics and less Time topic;
2. bob-dylan loved to use Location topic and didn't like express Love;
3. bruce-springsteen's songs contained all the topics with almost same weight;
4. david-bowie preferred Sing a Song topic and would not express his attitude in the songs;
5. elton-john loved Lost&Found topic, and used Joyful topic seldom, maybe he usually sang sad songs;
6. elvis-costello expressed Care and Attitude most;
7. eric-clapton's songs contained almost every topic with same weight.

**In short**, the artists usually expressed their feeling about love in their songs no matter nagetive or positive feelings in love. Though in the same era, the length of sentences in different artists' songs were different, maybe due to different music genres or different characters. Nevertheless, in general, shorter sentences were more popular. When it comes to Rock music, people love Rock music because it can contain a wide range of topics and express strong emotions. Rock lovers can show their feelings through this type of music easily and people can find their own stories by listening to the songs. As far as the rock songs I have listened to, the rhythms is usually very fast so that it can make happy people happier and sad people more sad.
