### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Data Story: the Collision of Lyrics and Emotions----What words did certain artists enjoy to use in their songs? What are the differences among selected artists? Why is Rock music so popular?
+ This project is conducted by [ Saier Gong (sg3772) ]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] 

Music is an improtant part in our daily life. In this project, I apply data cleaning and text mining methods to explore what type of sentences certain artists would like to use in their songs, and what kind of emotions they expressed. Also, based on the lyrics within the Rock genre, we identify several topics that the representative artists in this genre cover most in their songs.

The results show that the words "i", "love" and "you" appear in many songs and different artists preferred different length of sentences in the lyrics. In Rock genre, the songs usually cover a wide range of topics and have stronger emotions, that is why many people love to write Rock songs and why many people enjoy listening to rock songs.
